In my CV  latest version in the postgraduate section
You could see "Specialization in software engineering" these were not lies...

but this was not possible because they took away my quota.
"The National University of Medellin says" "that this was not possible because the specialization didn't start due to a lack of people" and for this reason I had to participate again the next semester to earn the position, a cheap excuse to take away what I earned.
They did not keep the quota that I had won for my own merits and achievements.
This is not my fault that the university can't start in this course...
(check supported folders)

This is something painful for me because it is unfair in every way, you can see how what I publish institutions here is manipulated by third parties who believe they are owners of public institutions with private interests.
In addition to this, I am a person of limited resources, I don't have 40 million of pesos to pay for a postgraduate study at a private university.
I came back from the USA for that.
For this reason
now I'm ready to start
My little computer business, if I'm not hired, or I'm going to starve quickly in this country.
Now I am going to dedicate myself to my computer security studies.!

Thanks to all the people who support me, for my honesty and principles.
Something that has been lost in many people.

Believe me. 
God is furious about that.
[Expect us].
